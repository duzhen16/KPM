								KPM OVERVIEW
Objectives:

1) isolation
	 |
	 |---- 1.1 creating a seperate addr space by altering page table	(done)
	 |---- 1.2 avoid kernel to disable seperate addr space
			 |
			 |---- 1.2.1 monitering page table update (page fault interrupt) to avoid kernel modifying page table to disable seperate addr space 	 (done)
			 |---- 1.2.2 instrumenting all MMU (CP15) configuration opetations to avoid kernel using unverified page table			
			 		-- implementing all "write to ttbr"  operations!
			 		-- implementing all "write to sctlr" operations to enable MMU persistently   (will)    


2) context switch
	 |
	 |---- 2.1 preventing kernel from gaining control while KPM is accessible at current status		(done)
	 |---- 2.2 making sure that in() function is the only way switch into KPM	 (done)





Thread model:

1) KPM integrity
	 |
	 |---- isolating KPM from kernel strictly  (ing)
2) kernel integrity
     |
	 |---- code integrity : modifying page table entries which specify kernel code to be Read-Only    (done)
	 |---- control flow integrity : modifying kernel data(e.g. ret-addr,function-pointers) to hijack control flow to run malicious logic  (will)



Implementation plans:
for isolation (refence to SKEE,TZ-RKP,SPROPES etc.):
	1. checking Page fault handler or page table update handler,placing hooks into these handlers so that hijacking control flow to jump into in()
	2. using IDA pro to indentify specific binary code which corresponding to writing to TTBR instructions,then replacing them with hooks jumping to in()
